          <p>
            This Cookie Policy explains how HeartCare ("we", "our", or "us") uses cookies and similar technologies to
            recognize you when you visit our website. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as
            well as your rights to control our use of them.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
            Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
            as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, HeartCare) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by
            parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable
            third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
            interactive content, and analytics).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.1 Essential Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are
            usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting
            your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then
            work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.2 Performance Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of
            our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around
            the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these
            cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.3 Functionality Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by
            us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages.
          </p>
          <p>If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.</p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3.4 Targeting Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies
            to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            They do not store directly personal information, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and
            internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. How to Control Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish. You can delete all cookies that are already on your
            computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may
            have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities
            may not work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about
